This is a web scraper developed as part of a technical test for employment, a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The app simply takes a Wikipedia url, then scrapes that page for information about bankruptcy and fraud and displays the results.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. The app is not deployed anywhere.
